include.js - v0.2

Minimalist Async Module Definition/Dependency Management library for javascript with support for optional
dependencies (and error handling support to be added).

Why another AMD implementation?
  * Support for optional dependencies
  * Graceful loading failures (with support for error handling callbacks)
  * Small enough to include in your main .html file (1.5KB minified)

Changelog:
v0.2
  * Implemented first pass of Error Callback support
  * Added sofea.include.version variable
  * Added alias to global method "require"
  * Added property "amd" to specify we implement the AMD spec (probably not 100% accurately at this point)

v0.1
  * First public release (complete rewrite from old public code)

Bugs/Todo:
  * add documentation
  * Timeouts not yet implemented
  * Logging/Debug API not implemented
  * Configuration API not implemented (direct access to sofea.baseDir will be "removed" at some point)
  * Add preservation of existing require/define methods (a la jquery's overriding of $)
  * Need to further test deeply nested dependencies
  * Need to fully support "AMD" API, (optional params on define are currently missing, probably more (need tests)
  * Add support for suspend/resume (for compilation of scripts)
  * Add script compiler
  * Add "context" support (i.e. remove all instance level vars, allow aquiring a new instance)
